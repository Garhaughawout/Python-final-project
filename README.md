Sports Player and Team Data Management

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This project is made to allow for easier managment of players and teams for any sport. It has funcionality that allows you to manage multiple things such as grabbing all the players from one team or finding players who average higher than a certain value of stats. This would make having stats and managing different teams rosters easier.


This Project is a CLI that gives you the options to work with two different things. Both Teams and Players.
When using the CLI you will be prompted with these options

1. Work With Teams
2. Work with Players
3. Delete a Player or Team
4. Exit

entering one of the options numbers will bring you to either a prompt or out of the CLI.
when you enter the number 1 you'll be prompted with these options next.

1. Find a Team by Name
2. Create a Team
3. Display all Teams
4. Grab all players from a team
5. Grab all teams with a stat higher than a value
6. Exit

These all would either execute an action or prompt you for information to perform the action. 


If you were to Work with players on the first prompt you would then be prompt with this.

1. Find a Player by Name
2. Create a Player
3. Display all Players
4. Grab all players with a stat higher than a value
5. Exit

these are all similar options to the teams section, but instead working with the players data.
